Kicking Off our Journey into Net+

Today we officially started our Intro to Network+, and I couldn’t be more excited to begin working toward certification!

We covered a lot of ground today, including:

Types of networks and their characteristics

A deeper dive into the OSI model and the devices that operate at each layer

Network topologies and how they influence design and function

The pros and cons of Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer networks

And a look into the troubleshooting process

I especially appreciated revisiting the OSI model — understanding what happens at each layer and what kind of hardware or software is involved really helped solidify the concept for me.

But my favorite part? Learning about the troubleshooting process. It honestly felt like solving a mystery — using logic and knowledge to isolate and resolve issues. 🔍💡

To cap off the day, we attended a panel discussion at Clark Atlanta University about the future of cybersecurity. The speakers talked about the evolving landscape, especially with the rise of Artificial Intelligence, and how it’s reshaping what success looks like in this field. Lots of insights on how to adapt and stay ahead in this ever-changing industry.

More learning ahead, but day one was great
