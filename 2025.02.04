Character Development & Career Growth

Today’s focus was all about diving deeper into character development and personal growth — both crucial parts of building a solid foundation in tech and cybersecurity.

We kicked off the day with a session led by Ron Cofield, who introduced us to the “Three Positives and Two Negatives” interview technique. It’s all about framing challenges in a way that still communicates your value. One example that stuck with me: describing impatience as a result of being highly driven to get the job done. The key takeaway? Use your negatives to reinforce your strengths — it’s all about perspective.

Later, we heard from Craig Baltes, Director of Information Security Services at Aflac. He shared real experiences that shaped his journey, providing valuable insights into how we can navigate our own. Hearing him reflect honestly on his strengths and weaknesses was powerful — a reminder that vulnerability and resilience are both essential on this path.

He also shared some of the media and resources he relies on to stay ahead in the constantly evolving world of cybersecurity. Definitely picked up a few recommendations I’ll be checking out.

Another impactful day of learning — not just about tech, but about becoming the kind of person who thrives in the industry.
