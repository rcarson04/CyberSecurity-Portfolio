A day in review 
"A day in review:  2025-03-03  Today we got to meet alot of the staff that will be working with us during this journey. The passion and enthusiasm that the speakers conveyed with their different speeches really gave me sense of encouragment. We also learn more about the facility, the types of support that is provided to the local community and the business model that has lead to success for the company. I look forward to what the next few day may hold
