Kicking things off with Inspiration and Community

Today was an energizing start to the journey! We had the opportunity to meet many of the amazing staff who will be supporting us along the way â€” and their passion and enthusiasm were truly contagious. Each speaker brought something unique to the table, and their words left me feeling motivated, encouraged, and ready to grow.

We also got a closer look at the facility and the incredible work being done for the local community. It was inspiring to learn about the support systems in place, the impact being made, and the business model thatâ€™s driving real success.

Iâ€™m feeling grateful to be part of something this meaningful â€” and Iâ€™m genuinely excited to see what the next few days have in store. Letâ€™s go! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
