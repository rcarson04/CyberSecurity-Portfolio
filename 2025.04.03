A day in review 
Our speaker for this week, Adam Bricker, started to break down questions to ask ourselves when getting involved with cyber security. He described how important "collaboration" is in this cyber security field and how that can affect your success. He also spoke about being "hungry" to find  resolution to an issue and to be selfish when it comes to your time and attention, segwaying into time management. I did find today very helping in planning my new future.
