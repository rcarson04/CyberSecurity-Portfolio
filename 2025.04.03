Building the cyber security mindset with Adam Bricker
This week we had the privilege of hearing from Adam Bricker, and his message truly resonated on multiple levels. He challenged us to ask the deeper questions — not just about cybersecurity as a career, but about who we are becoming as we step into this ever-evolving field.

One of the standout themes from his talk was the importance of collaboration. In cybersecurity, success isn’t just about being the smartest person in the room — it’s about working together, sharing insights, and building a strong network of professionals who are just as committed to protecting information as you are. Collaboration, as Adam put it, isn’t optional — it’s essential.

He also emphasized the need to be "hungry" for solutions — to develop an almost relentless drive to get to the root of a problem and resolve it. That hunger is what separates those who are simply doing the job from those who are truly mastering the craft.

Another key takeaway was around time and energy management. Adam encouraged us to be a little “selfish” when it comes to protecting our focus. In a field that demands precision and constant learning, knowing how to manage your time effectively is a superpower. This naturally tied into a powerful conversation about building habits that support our goals.

Today’s session wasn’t just informative — it was transformational. It gave me new tools, a refreshed mindset, and a clearer vision for what I want my future in cybersecurity to look like. Excited for what’s ahead! 🔒🚀
