A day in review 
Today was a special one. Our cohort, in collaboration with City of Refuge and NPursuit, hosted an incredible tech event for A.I. Day in the A (Atlanta) — and what an experience it was!

We featured three powerful presentations exploring the impact and potential of artificial intelligence in the world of cybersecurity and tech careers:

🔓 Unlocking GPT
A deep dive into how businesses can create cutting-edge AI solutions using tools like GPT. Real use cases and creative implementations were front and center.

🚀 Fast Track
Focused on how to elevate your career using AI tools like ChatGPT, Interviewsby.ai, Gamma, and Jobscan.co. We explored how to gain an edge in job hunting, personal branding, and upskilling.

⚖️ Ethics Unveiled
A timely and important conversation about making AI work for everyone while staying grounded in ethical practices. A reminder that innovation must also be responsible.

It was an absolute pleasure to be part of this amazing day — helping others discover the transformative power of AI and how it can enhance the way we all navigate the modern tech landscape.

The future is here, and it’s intelligent. 💡✨
