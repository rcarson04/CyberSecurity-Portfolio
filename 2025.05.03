 Building Habits, Hearing Stories, and Exploring New Ways to Learn

Today was all about growth, impact, and self-awareness â€” a powerful reminder that the journey we're on isn't just about gaining technical skills, but also about shaping who we are as individuals.

We kicked off the day with a meaningful discussion on the power of forming positive habits. Itâ€™s amazing how something as simple as a small daily change can create a ripple effect throughout every area of your life. Whether itâ€™s staying consistent, setting boundaries, or being intentional with our goals â€” weâ€™re learning how those little actions shape a stronger, more focused version of ourselves.

We also had the honor of meeting Bruce Deal, who shared the incredible origin story of City of Refuge. Hearing firsthand how the organization was founded and how it has grown over time was truly inspiring. It's not just about what's happening here in Georgia â€” we learned about how their impact reaches across multiple states, providing life-changing services in education, housing, workforce development, and more. Itâ€™s a powerful example of what vision, passion, and purpose can achieve.

To wrap up the day, we explored the different styles of learning â€” visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and beyond. Understanding how we each absorb information best helps tailor how we grow in this field. Personally, I walked away with a better sense of how I can leverage my learning style to absorb material more effectively and stay motivated.

All in all, today was a reminder that weâ€™re not just preparing for a job â€” weâ€™re preparing for a purpose-driven future. Looking forward to what comes next! ðŸ’¡ðŸ’ª
