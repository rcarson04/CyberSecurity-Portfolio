a day in review 
Continuing with the theme of character development and preparation to step into the world of cybersecurity, our speaker Adam Bricker went into further detail about the skills and knowledge to be successful in this career field. we spoke about the way people retain information and gave quotes as examples of how to approach this path moving forward. He spoke about ways to stand out or make syouself noticeable and understanding what motivates you. But what stuck with me the most today is when we discussed ditching "dream killers". Thats the part that will stick with me during this process.
