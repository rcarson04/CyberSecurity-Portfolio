Ditching Dream Killers & Owning the Cyber Secuirty Journey 

Today’s session was another powerful step forward in our journey of character development and preparation for a future in cybersecurity. Our speaker, Adam Bricker, returned to dive even deeper into the mindset, skills, and strategies needed to truly succeed in this field — and his message couldn’t have come at a better time.

We explored the different ways people retain and process information, which was a great reminder that everyone learns differently — and that’s okay. Adam shared quotes and examples that encouraged us to find our own rhythm and lean into the methods that help us grow best. Cybersecurity isn’t just about technical knowledge; it’s also about self-awareness and adaptability.

He also touched on what it takes to stand out in a competitive industry. From being intentional with how you show up to understanding what truly motivates you, it’s clear that success starts from within. The more we understand our “why,” the more we can stay focused and push forward with purpose.

But the part that really hit home for me was the conversation around "ditching the dream killers." We all have doubts, distractions, or even people in our lives that might not understand our vision — and Adam made it clear that it’s okay to let those go. In fact, it’s necessary if we’re serious about chasing something bigger.

That message stuck with me, and I know it’s one I’ll carry through the rest of this journey. This process isn’t just about learning tech — it’s about becoming the kind of person who won’t let anything stop them.
