A day in review 
I missed 3.07 and 3.10 due to a loss of a close family memeber the week before class started. That was definitely a tough situation to bounce back from but i am dedicated to starting my path in cyber security. On this day, we started with a review of the components of a computer. examples include the different types of storage, intefaces, operating systems, cards, as well as the main components like the CPU and RAM. We also spoke about programs that are ran by the operating system and how it is the nervous system of a computer. The differences of hardware and software were interesting to hear about too.
