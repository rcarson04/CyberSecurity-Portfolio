Bouncing back and diving into computer components

The past couple of weeks have been challenging — I missed class on 3.07 and 3.10 due to the loss of a close family member just before the program began. It’s never easy navigating personal loss, but I’m proud to say I’m back and fully committed to pursuing my path in cybersecurity. This journey means a lot to me, and I’m showing up every day with purpose and determination.

Today marked my first full day back, and we jumped right into the fundamentals — starting with a detailed review of the components of a computer. It was a great refresher and foundational knowledge that sets the stage for deeper learning ahead.

We explored:

Different types of storage (HDD, SSD, removable)

Interfaces and ports

Operating systems and how they interact with hardware

Expansion cards and their functions

And of course, core components like the CPU and RAM

One of the most fascinating takeaways was the analogy of the operating system as the “nervous system” of the computer — constantly managing, coordinating, and keeping everything running smoothly behind the scenes.

We also broke down the key differences between hardware and software, which gave me a better understanding of how both worlds work together to create a functional machine. It’s incredible how these individual components work in sync to power everything we do.

Despite the tough start, I’m feeling hopeful and energized to keep pushing forward. Each day is a new opportunity to grow, and I’m embracing it one step at a time. Onward and upward! 🚀🧠
