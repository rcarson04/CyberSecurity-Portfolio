Real talk with Paul Farley - Insights from a Cyber Security Leader

Today we had the privilege of hearing from Paul Farley, a Senior Information Security Officer, whose journey and insights in the field of cybersecurity were nothing short of inspiring.

Paul walked us through his personal career path — the highs, the pivots, and the bold decisions that helped him grow. One moment that really stood out was when he shared how he took a step back in pay in order to break through the "ceiling" he had hit in previous roles. It was a strategic move that opened doors to larger business opportunities and long-term success. That kind of career foresight and humility was incredibly eye-opening.

He also offered practical advice on how to stand out during job interviews, emphasizing the importance of being relatable and authentic. Rather than simply listing off technical skills, Paul encouraged us to align our personal experiences with the story we're trying to tell. It’s not just what you know — it’s how you communicate your growth, challenges, and drive.

Another major takeaway? Stay curious. Paul reminded us that the best cybersecurity professionals never stop learning. Asking questions, staying updated on trends, and continuously building your skill set are key. And above all, he stressed the importance of having a strong "why" — knowing the reason you’re pursuing this path helps you stay focused, especially when things get tough.

Today’s session was more than just motivational — it was strategic and empowering. It reminded me that success isn’t always a straight path, and sometimes the best moves come from thinking long-term and staying true to your purpose.

Feeling more inspired than ever to keep pushing forward in this journey. 🔐💼💡
