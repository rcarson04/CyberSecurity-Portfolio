A day in review
Today we went further into detail about the different types of operating systems like Batch, Time Sharing, Distributed, Network and Real Time. We aslo discussed that the function of an operating system as it being the interface between the user and hardware as a review for the previous day. For a new topic, we talked about virtualization and different types of virtual machines. Our instructor, Mr. Davis, spoke in detail about the history of virtual machines and what people had to do before virtual machines were in use in professional settings.
