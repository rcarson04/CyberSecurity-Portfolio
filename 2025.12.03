A day in review
On this day, we had a key note speaker Paul Farley. As a Senior Information Security Officer he gave valuable insight into his path with cyber security. What stood out to me was his mention of taking a step back in pay in order to break through the "ceiling" of his previous positions so he would advance his career with large business. He also gave insight to what he looks for in employees and how to be relatable in job interview by aligning personal experiences with information you are trying to convey. He also expressed a need to be curious in the pursuit of knowledge and to have a "why" to further your career in cyber security
