A day in review 
Today in class, we did a brief review of how to set up virtual machines and continued into types of VMWare. The virtual machines we will be utilizing during the class will be Ubuntu and CentOS currently. We took time to download and install said programs. We also covered types of RAM and the two types of Hypervisors and different servers. A key part of our conversation today went over the benefits of hypervisors and which of the two types we will work with in the future.
