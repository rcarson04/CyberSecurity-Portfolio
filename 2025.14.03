Deepening our understanding of VMWare and Diving into Linux Essentials

This week has been all about building confidence with tools and concepts that are foundational to both virtualization and Linux systems. After previously learning how to set up VMWare on a PC, today’s session shifted gears a bit as we took time to explore the key terminology and components that make up VMWare and command-line environments.

Some of the important terms we broke down included:

🧩 Kernel – the core of the operating system that communicates directly with hardware

💻 Shell – the interface that allows users to interact with the OS

🖥️ Terminal – the environment where commands are input and executed

🔍 Shell vs. Terminal – a helpful distinction between the interface (shell) and the tool we use to access it (terminal)

✍️ Syntax – the specific structure or rules for writing terminal commands

🔧 Terminal Commands – basic, yet powerful, tools for navigating and managing a system

We wrapped up the day with our first chapter assessment, which covered everything we've learned so far this week. I'm proud to share that I passed with an 86.67% — a strong start and a solid motivator to keep pushing forward!

Looking ahead to our work on March 17, we shifted our focus to the Linux file system — learning not just what it looks like, but how it functions and is structured. We explored:

📁 File system components

🛣️ The path from storage to file

🔑 Basic Linux commands for navigating and managing files

📍 Relative vs. Absolute paths and why they matter

🪢 The “chain of command” when executing commands or accessing files

It’s been a packed few days, but I’m really starting to feel more confident with command-line tools and how everything connects in a virtualized environment. Each lesson builds on the last, and it's amazing to see how all these concepts are starting to come together.

Ready to keep climbing and mastering the skills that’ll shape my future in cybersecurity! 🧠💪💻
