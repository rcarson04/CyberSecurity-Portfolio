a day in review

On this monday we started out by going into more detail about the data link layer of the osi model. we spoke about the physical addressing of network devices and frames. we learned about what polling is and token ring/bus and how they help prevent crashes. we also learned about CSMA/CD and that it provisions how multiple devices communicate on a shared connection. we learned the difference between a hub and a switch. Briefly discussed standards of ethernet and reviewed the OSI Model, type of devices and equipment are associated with each layer, the different types of fiber optics and touched on the different types of wiring classifications. We talked about how data can be transmitted. we learned about the differences between a bridge and a repeater. We defined terms like hub, switch, MAC, port, router and others. we wrapped up by learning how many bytes are in a frame and the parts that make up a frame.
