Wednesdays are usually reserved for character development and key note speakers. We started the day out speaking with Ron Cofield who is an instructor and also mentor for our cohort at City of Refuge. The focus of this lesson was about having disciplines that help shape our goals. He challenged us to think about some things that we want to change about ourselves to make achieving goals easier. Whether that be limiting screen time before sleep or carving out time to study within our weekly routine or creating the space needed sp you can focus on a specific task, these are all important disciplines to have to secure a bright future. Our key note speaker was not able to attend, so we spent the rest of the day working as a group to complete some of our labs in the Comptia Net + coursework.
