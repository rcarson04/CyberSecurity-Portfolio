Wednesdays at City of Refuge are typically dedicated to character development sessions and keynote speakers who inspire and guide us on our professional journeys. This week was no exception in terms of growth and learning, even though the day unfolded a little differently than planned.

We kicked off the morning with an engaging session led by Ron Cofield, one of our instructors and mentors here at City of Refuge. Ron’s focus for the day was on the power of discipline in helping us reach our personal and professional goals. He challenged each of us to reflect on specific habits we could adjust or build to set ourselves up for success.

Some of the examples he shared included limiting screen time before bed to improve rest, carving out intentional blocks of time each week to study, and creating an environment free of distractions to fully concentrate on important tasks. These small, consistent disciplines, he emphasized, are what pave the way for a bright and sustainable future.

Unfortunately, our scheduled keynote speaker was unable to join us. However, we used the time productively by coming together as a group to collaborate on completing some of our CompTIA Network+ labs. It was a great opportunity to not only sharpen our technical skills but also strengthen our teamwork and problem-solving abilities.

Days like these remind me that growth isn't always about big moments — sometimes it's about showing up, staying adaptable, and making the most of the opportunities we’re given.
