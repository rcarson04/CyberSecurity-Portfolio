A day in review
We started out the new week talking about Identity and Access Management. We taled about Identity defining "who you are", Authentification defining "proving who you are", Authorization defining "what you can do", and Accounting defining "what did you do". We spoke about the two types of users, types of servers and diffrent types of Groups in regard to access. We closed up this day by reviewing different commands and cryptographic algorhythms.
