In today's class, we revisited the class ranges of IP addresses which led into learning about subnet masks and how they are a shortcut to knowing how many bits are in each part of the IP address. We learned that placement of digits on subnet tells you what the host is and what the network number is. We also discussed how ARP, address resolution protocol, is used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses. We aslo discussed IP settings in the form of Static or Dynamic settings. Static would have you entering IP addresses manually, which is permanent until it is changed. Or dynamic, which is automatically generarted and can change any anytime. I assume, that Dynamic would present an issue because if the IP adress changes it can present an issue with communication with other nodes at random. we also discussed NAT, which translated IP addresses and revisited the DHCP process.
