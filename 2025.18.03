A day in review 
Today we started by reviewing yesterday's material. We moved on with a new topic, user permissions. We discussed the differnt types of users and read, write, and execute permissions. we also discussed how to use commands in Linux to change or add permissions to a user. We discussed the numercial values for said commands as well.
