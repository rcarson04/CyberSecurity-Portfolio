today in class we started out talking about Automatic Private IP Addressing also known as APIPA. It has specific ranges to describe IP adresses that are used if a system is unable to get a response/IP address. We revisited subnet mask and how it relates to this topic and it translates to a large network being divided into many smaller networks. We talked about CIDR or classless Interdomain routing which allows only part of an octet to be used for the network address. We revisited the OSI model to discuss how the Data link layer and Network layer route packets and and switches frames to be forwarded which led to discussing the different kinds of broadcasts. Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast all have there own uses and we learned what they do. IPv6 however does not use broadcast, it only uses unicast, multicast, and anycast.
