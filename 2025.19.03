From Graduate to Guide: Real talk with Almuni and Building our Professional Presence

Today was something special — not just another day in class, but a true look into what life can look like after completing this program. We had the pleasure of hearing from Don Howard, a proud graduate of the very same program I’m currently enrolled in, and his story brought both motivation and clarity to the path ahead.

Don didn’t just speak about success — he showed what it looks like when you stay committed, earn your certifications, and stay hungry in the cybersecurity space. He gave us real-world insight into:

🛠️ The tools and programs he currently uses in his role

🎯 The importance of being intentional in how we present ourselves — both online and in person

🚀 How to navigate the transition from student to cybersecurity professional

It’s always inspiring to hear from someone who was just in our shoes not too long ago, now thriving in the field we’re aiming to enter. It made the future feel more tangible and within reach.

We also had a powerful session with Ron Cofield, who led us through a personality assessment. This was all about understanding our individual characteristics, strengths, and tendencies — and how they can play a role in our communication style, teamwork, and leadership. It was a great reminder that self-awareness is key in both personal and professional growth.

🗣️ Before wrapping up the day, we touched on something that’s simple but so important — the elevator pitch. We discussed:

How to confidently introduce ourselves

Ways to tailor our pitch depending on who we’re speaking to

How to use it to spark meaningful conversations and open doors while networking

Today was a full-circle kind of day — from envisioning the future, understanding ourselves more deeply, to learning how to put our best foot forward. It reminded me that this journey is about more than just technical skills — it’s also about character, communication, and confidence.

I’m fired up and looking forward to continuing to grow into the cybersecurity pro I’m meant to be! 💬🔐🌱
