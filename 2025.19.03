Today was a treat because our speaker was a graduate of the very same program i am currently enrolled in. Don Howard truly gave insight of what to expect after we complete the course and gain certifications in cyber. He gave insight on what programs are used in his current position and encouraged us to be intentional with how we represent ourselves. We also spoke with Ron Cofield who had us take a personality assessment and broke down our current characteristics. Before class ended, we also talked about an "elevator pitch" and how to craft a conversation starter to better network with other professioals
