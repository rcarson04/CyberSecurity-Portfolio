A day in review
Today we started learning about package management. we spoke about source code and how anyone can create their own distros. There are different methods of managing software, but for us we spoke about Red Hat and Debian for managing linux software. A package is a collection of software, like a program or a library, bundled with everything it needs to run. It usually contains the programâ€™s files, instructions for installation, and data like its version number. we also learned that package management is convenient because the manager will search for and update software on its own because it comes with sutomated instructions for the progrm itself
