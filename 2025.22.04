Today we started talking about the classifications of routing. route info protocol, interior gateway routing protocol, open shortest path first, enhanced interior gateway routing protocol, border gateway protocol. distance only shares with neribors which is slower and associated with smaller networks. Linkstate shares all routing which is faster and associated with larger networks. Distsance vector protocol- rotuing protocols that dettermine the best path based on hops. RIP - used to exchange info between routers in a computer network. has a limit of 15 hops, slow convergences, easy to implement and sutiable for smaller networks. IGRP is Cisco propriatary routing protocol designed to address limitations like latency.
