Today we started talking about static mapping which means physically going to each routing and getting the information or dynaminc which would be an automatic broadcast. we reviewed routing protocols: distance, link state, hybrid, exterior. We moved on to learning about  Network Address Translation or NAT. Private IP addresses cant access the internet, so NAT translates an IP address to a public one so it can access the internet. We learned about SNAT that deals more with incoming traffic and can run out of IP addresses and DNAT that deals more with outbound traffic and disguises IP addresses that are first available to use from a table you already have. We were introduced to Port Address Translation which utilizes one port address using port numbers for multiple points of contact. poert numbers are used to mark traffic from specific places. a demonstratin was given on port forwarding
