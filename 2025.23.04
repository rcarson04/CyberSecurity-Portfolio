Guest Speaker Spotlight: Darrell J. Stenson — Lessons in Growth, Networking, and Resilience
Today we had the incredible opportunity to hear from Darrell J. Stenson, who holds multiple prestigious certifications including CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker), CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional), and C|CISO (Certified Chief Information Security Officer). His story and advice were truly inspiring and packed with valuable takeaways for anyone serious about building a career in cybersecurity.

Mr. Stenson began by sharing his diverse background.
Before stepping into cybersecurity, he served in the military, where he first got hands-on experience with technology as an Information Technology Specialist. After completing his military service, he transitioned into real estate, working as a realtor. However, when the housing market crashed around 2008, he found himself needing to pivot again.
He took on truck driving to support himself, all while never losing sight of his larger goal: becoming a major figure in the tech and cybersecurity world. His journey is a testament to persistence, adaptability, and hard work.

Key Advice from Mr. Stenson:
Certifications Matter: He strongly encouraged us to pursue industry-recognized certifications such as:

Security+ (Sec+)

GIAC certifications (Global Information Assurance Certification)

ISC certifications (International Information System Security Certification Consortium)

CompTIA certifications

Knowledge in JavaScript and the SAV+ platform.

Network Relentlessly:
Attend tech events, meetups, and conferences.
Use your personal connections — family, friends, acquaintances — to help open doors. Opportunities often come from people you know!

Know Your Resume:
Be able to speak confidently about everything listed on your resume. If you can’t explain it, you shouldn’t have it there.

Focus on AI:
To stay ahead in cybersecurity, staying updated on trends like Artificial Intelligence is crucial. AI is rapidly changing the landscape, and those who embrace it early will be in high demand.

Stretch Beyond Your Comfort Zone:
Mr. Stenson emphasized the importance of taking on challenging roles — even ones where you may not feel fully proficient yet. Growth happens when you stretch yourself beyond what you think you’re capable of.

Strategic Career Moves:
Don't be afraid to take jobs that move you closer to your ultimate goals, even if they aren't your "dream job" right now.

Build Discipline Through Routine:
Having a consistent routine is key to building momentum and achieving long-term goals.

Own Your Individuality:
Strive to be "one of one" — meaning build your unique brand and skills that make you stand out.

Regrets and Lessons:
Mr. Stenson openly shared one of his professional regrets: not completing the PMP (Project Management Professional) certification earlier in his career.
This was a powerful reminder that project management skills are valuable assets, even for those focused primarily on technical paths.

Recommended Reading:
Mr. Stenson also left us with a couple of powerful book recommendations to sharpen our professional and personal skills:

Smart Brevity by Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen, and Roy Schwartz — A guide to communicating more effectively and efficiently.

The Wisdom of the Bullfrog by Admiral William H. McRaven — Lessons in leadership from a seasoned U.S. Navy SEAL.

Final Takeaway:
Mr. Stenson's story reminded us that career growth isn’t always a straight line. Hard work, networking, adaptability, and a willingness to constantly stretch yourself are key ingredients to success. His visit left us feeling motivated and ready to keep pushing toward our goals, one certification and one connection at a time.
