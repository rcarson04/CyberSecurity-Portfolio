A day in review
on this monday, we started network fundamentals starting with numbering systems. We spoke about hexidecimal system that uses 16 sysmbols and how it convert it from and to binary. We also spoke abouy Analog and how it is counted. We started talking about the OSI model and the different layers as well as TCP/IP. we briefly touched on network ports and how they determine what apps will handle communication to certain processes.
