Today we were introduced to firewalls. Firewalls are filters traffic from entering or exiting the network. There are different types of firewalls: Hardware which can be stand alone devices that can be integrated with routers, Software which can be operating system based or 3rd party software based, Cloud based which would be a service provided and Unified Threat Manager which is an all in one security application which is ideal for businesses. These are setup to control traffic in both directions, ACL tells the router what is allowed through. We covered more info about filtering. Stateless or packet filtering filters based on IP addresses protocol and port numbers, acts at the network layer, suitable for smaller networks but does not retain any record. Versus Stateful or curcuit level gateway. it inspects packets and tracks the state of active connections, acts at the session layer, ideal for corporate where data protection is vital, resource intensive and maintains a record of connections passing through the filter/firewall. we covered port, MAC, IP, content and dynamic filtering. we learned what a proxy server does, acts as a middle man and retrieves info out on the internet privately which can save bandwith. It encrypts data while surfing and has inbound and outbound detection. We also talked about forward and reverse traffic
