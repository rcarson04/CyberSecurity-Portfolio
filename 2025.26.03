Today’s visit to Cox Enterprises was one of the most inspiring moments so far in this cybersecurity journey. We had the chance to explore the inner workings of a major company and hear firsthand from Hadji Hicks, a successful cybersecurity professional who graduated from the same cohort we’re currently enrolled in.

Hadji Hicks was not only informative — he was relatable and motivating. His story of entering the tech industry and growing into a full-time cybersecurity role really resonated with us. He spoke honestly about the challenges, the learning curve, and the mindset it takes to thrive in this space.
