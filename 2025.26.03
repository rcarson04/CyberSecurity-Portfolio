Day day in review
Today we visited a job site. Hadji Hicks was our guide and he spoke about the history of Cox Inc. and also his person journey that led him to his current position. Mr. Hicks also graduated from the very same program i am currently attending so it was very inspirational to hear about his path. He did speak about some of the tools he uses currently so it help paint a picture of what direction we need to start looking in to be better prepared for our future.
