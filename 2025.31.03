🖥️ Linux Meets GitHub: Putting Knowledge into Action

Today’s class took a hands-on turn, and it was a rewarding shift from theory to execution!

We’ve talked a lot about using Linux in previous lessons — navigating the file system, entering commands, and accessing web pages. But today we took it a step further by using Linux to actually interact with GitHub — and it felt like a major milestone.

🔧 Creating a GitHub Repository Through Linux
For the first time, we used Linux to create and push to a personal GitHub repository. It was a cool moment to see the terminal come alive, not just as a place for commands, but as a tool to connect with one of the most widely used platforms in the tech world.

Here’s what we covered:

Initializing a Git repository locally

Creating a new GitHub repo

Linking the local repo to the remote one using SSH or HTTPS

Adding and committing files

Pushing changes from Linux directly to GitHub

Being able to move between Linux and GitHub made everything we’ve been learning feel more connected and purposeful.

🔁 Understanding Git as a Version Control System
We also dove deeper into what Git really is — not just a platform, but a version control system that tracks changes, enables collaboration, and protects your work over time.

We talked about how Git:

Helps manage codebases of all sizes

Allows for rollback to previous versions

Makes it easier to collaborate with other developers through branching and merging

We explored popular platforms that use Git, including:

GitHub (most popular for collaboration and open source)

GitLab (with built-in CI/CD pipelines)

Bitbucket (popular in enterprise environments)

💡 Key Takeaways:
Using Linux to push code to GitHub builds practical skills for real-world dev and security environments.

Understanding Git as a version control system is essential for collaboration and project management.

Today was a great example of bridging theory with real-world tools — and seeing your work live on GitHub is incredibly motivating.

Getting to apply what we’ve learned in a real-world context made today’s class one of the most exciting so far. Every command, every push, and every commit helped reinforce the power of what we’re learning.

Ready for the next challenge! 💻✨🔐
