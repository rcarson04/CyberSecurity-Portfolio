A day in review
Today in class we started working on something a little different. We have spoken about how to access web pages through linux previously, but today we actually used linux to access and create a repository on our personal Github pages which was pretty neat. Hearing about what all you can do with linux is informational, but getting to execute something from linux brought it full circle. We also spoke about Git as a version control system and its different platforms.
