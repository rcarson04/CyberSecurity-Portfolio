Today we spoke about the importance of forming positive habits and how that starts to change other factors in your life. We also got the chance to meet with Bruce Deal and listen to him speak more about how City of Refuge and how it got started. We also got to hear more about the different areas of service that are provided not only in Georgia but other states around the country. we wrapped up the day by talking about different forms of learning, all of which i can see how it can apply to myself.
