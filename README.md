#  About Me

** Ralph E. Carson II **

** Hometown: Cleveland, OH **

** Prior Experience: Although I am new to IT, my past roles have helped me build a foundation for cyber security. I am familiar with identifying phishing attempts, recognizing social engineers, managing ongoing threats, and minimizing potential damage to customers or businesses. I am eager to deepen my technical knowledge of cyber security to advance my career. My motivation stems from several sources: my son, who has a strong knowledge of computers, inspires me to pursue this field to help guide him in his future career; personal experiences with family members who have been victims of data breaches, making me want to help others stay safe; and working at a telecommunications company that suffered two major data breaches in 2024, which allowed me to witness firsthand the consequences of such events.

** Career Plans: My goal is to complete cyber security training and start a stable and rewarding path to gain as much knowledge as possible to further my professional career. Starting out as an security analyst would be ideal and would help me reach the position of CISO one day. I fully intend to devote my focus on achieving this goal for a more robust and bright future. **

** Proud Project: My most rewarding role to date was provided to me because at that time my product knowledge and analytical thinking afforded me to be seen as an asset to a previous company. Instead of dealing with customers firsthand, my task was to help other employees navigate difficult escalations, complicated situations, and technical issues with hardware and software. **
