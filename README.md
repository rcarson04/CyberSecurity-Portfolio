#  About Me

** Ralph E. Carson II **

** Hometown: Cleveland, OH **

** My Prior Experience: While I may be new to the world of IT, my previous professional experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in cyber awareness and risk management—skills that directly support a transition into cybersecurity. In past roles, I’ve developed an intuitive understanding of how to recognize phishing attempts, identify signs of social engineering, and respond to ongoing threats in real-time. I’ve also worked to mitigate potential harm to both customers and the organization, reinforcing my commitment to protecting people and systems.

My passion for cybersecurity is driven by several powerful motivators. My son, who already shows strong aptitude in computers, inspires me daily—I want to grow alongside him in this field and help guide his future. I’ve also witnessed close family members fall victim to data breaches, fueling my desire to be part of the solution and protect others from similar harm.

Additionally, while working at a telecommunications company, I experienced the aftermath of two major data breaches in 2024. Seeing the chaos and urgency surrounding those incidents gave me a firsthand look at the critical role cybersecurity professionals play—and solidified my determination to join their ranks. These moments have shaped my “why,” and now, I’m excited to strengthen my technical skills, pursue certifications, and become a proactive force in keeping systems secure and people protected.**

**Career Plans: My ultimate goal is to build a long-lasting, rewarding career in the field of cybersecurity—one that not only challenges me but also allows me to grow continuously, contribute meaningfully, and help protect organizations and individuals in an increasingly digital world.

I am currently focused on completing my cybersecurity training and laying down a solid technical foundation. My first professional milestone is to secure a role as a Security Analyst, where I can apply what I’ve learned, gain hands-on experience, and continue sharpening my skill set in a real-world environment. I believe this role will serve as the perfect launchpad into a broader cybersecurity journey.

As I grow in knowledge and experience, I plan to pursue relevant industry certifications (such as CompTIA Security+, CISSP, and CEH), and gradually take on leadership roles with increasing responsibility. My long-term vision is to ascend to the position of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)—a role where I can drive strategic decisions, build resilient teams, and create proactive security cultures within organizations.

I am fully committed to this path and excited for the road ahead. With a deep sense of purpose and a clear vision for the future, I’m ready to embrace every opportunity to learn, lead, and protect.**

** Proud Project:One of the most rewarding moments in my career so far came when I was offered a specialized role that recognized my strengths in product knowledge and analytical thinking. At that time, I had been consistently demonstrating an ability to break down complex technical issues and think critically under pressure. Because of that, I was entrusted with a new responsibility—one that shifted me from direct customer interactions into a more strategic, internal support role.

In this position, I served as a go-to resource for my peers, helping them navigate challenging escalations, troubleshoot intricate hardware and software issues, and handle high-stress customer situations with confidence. It was incredibly fulfilling to know that my insight and experience were making a broader impact, not just on customers, but on the success of the team as a whole.

This experience taught me the value of mentorship, teamwork, and clear communication under pressure—all skills that continue to shape my journey as I transition into the cybersecurity field. It reminded me that being seen as a reliable asset doesn’t always come from being the loudest in the room, but from consistently showing up with solutions, patience, and a drive to help others succeed.**
